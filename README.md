Objective

The purpose of this notebook is to summarize and visualise of the most players of seasons between 2012 and 2024.

I tried to study who are the best goalscorers, players with more assists cards.
Also made a small analyse about Sporting Clube de Portugal.

I'll share some graphs that are in my project.

Also gonna add two graphs that I couldnt load on github but its in the code.
